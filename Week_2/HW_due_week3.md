# Part 2 - Wire Framing

### UX design requires effective communication and collaboration with different teams.
### Wireframing is a vital tool for generating ideas in UX design.
So it's important to deliberate over details before diving into screen design.
### Considerations for wireframing:
* Clarify the problem by asking key questions - purpose of project, how the problem is identified, target audience, and where the design will be implemented.
* Collaborative sketching helps identify interactions and workflows.
* Seek early feedback for technical insights and timelines - aids in scoping out development timeframes
* Wireframing tools for efficiency - keyboard shortcuts, templates, do what you can to save time
* Tailor fidelity of wireframes to the audience's level of understanding.


#### Focus on wireframing solutions aligned with the project's goals and target audience.
