Add your github repo link to the class roster google doc

Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We won’t be using Photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

Make a new folder in your HW repo called Week_1. Create a Markdown file containing a recipe card (CSS styling is optional). The recipe card should contain:

A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
Brief description of the recipe
List of ingredients
List of instructions
Take a look at this MarkDown cheat sheet. Use it to format your recipe with different text sizes and styles as well as bulleted and numbered lists. Think Hierarchy

Use git add git commit and git push to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.
